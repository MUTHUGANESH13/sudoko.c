# Mini Projects Repository

This repository contains various mini projects implemented in **C++**, **Java**, **C**, and **Python**. These projects demonstrate basic concepts
and problem-solving techniques using different programming languages.

## Projects

### 1. C++ Projects
- ATM Machine(https://github.com/MUTHUGANESH13/mini-project/blob/main/ATM%20Machine.cpp)
   
  This project implements a basic ATM system where users can create accounts, deposit money,  withdraw money, view their balance, check their transaction
  history, and calculate interest on their balance over a specified number of years. The system supports authentication using a username and password,
  ensuring that each transaction is secure. It demonstrates the use of  C++ classes, structures, maps, vectors, and basic authentication mechanisms.

### 2. Java Projects
- [Music Player]([./path-to-java-project](https://github.com/MUTHUGANESH13/mini-project/blob/main/Music%20player.java))
  
  This project implements a simple music player that allows users to manage and play songs from a playlist. The app includes features to play a selected
  song, pause, resume, stop, play the next or previous song, and replay the current song. Additionally, users can view a list of all available songs.
  The project demonstrates the use of basic OOP principles, including class design, lists, and switch case constructs for user interaction.

### 3. C Projects
- [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/MUTHUGANESH13/mini-project/blob/main/sudoko.c)  

  This project implements a Sudoku solver that allows users to interactively input values into a Sudoku board, reset the board, change the board size,
  and solve the puzzle. The program supports grid sizes from 4x4 to 36x36, automatically adjusting the block sizes based on the dimensions of the grid.
  Users can input values directly into specific cells and receive solutions to their puzzles. The solver uses backtracking to find the solution and checks
  for invalid entries at every step. This project demonstrates the use of arrays, recursion, and basic input handling in C.

- [voting system](https://github.com/MUTHUGANESH13/mini-project/blob/main/voting%20system.c)  

  This project implements a basic voting system where users can cast their votes, view candidate information, and check voting statistics.
  It includes features such as candidate modification, vote counting, and identification of the leading candidate. Admins can manage voter IDs
  and candidate details with a password-protected system.

### 4. Python Projects
- [Typing tutor](https://github.com/MUTHUGANESH13/mini-project/blob/main/Typing%20tutor.py)  

  This project implements a typing tutor that helps users measure their typing speed and accuracy. The program allows users to input a paragraph, which they must
  retype as quickly and accurately as possible. It then calculates and displays the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and the accuracy percentage based on
  how closely the retyped text matches the original. The project demonstrates the use of basic string manipulation, time tracking, and user input in Python.

## How to Run

1. **C++ Projects:**  
   Navigate to the project directory and use the following commands to compile and run:
   ```bash
   g++ project_name.cpp -o output_name
   ./output_name
